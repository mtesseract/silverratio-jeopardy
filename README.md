Silverratio Jeopardy
====================

Silverratio Jeopardy is a free implementation of a game resembling a
popular quiz show. It is written in Haskell using Gtk2Hs as GUI
Toolkit.

This package consists of three programs:

* jeopardy: This is the game

* jeopardy-editor: Editor for data files used by Jeopardy.

* jeopardy-compiler: Parses the data files generated by
  jeopardy-editor, interpretes the contained text as LaTeX, compiles
  it with LaTeX into pictures and outputs a compiled version of the
  data files. These "*.jdc" files (Jeopardy Data Compiled) can be
  loaded by the game.

* jeopardy-dump: Pretty-prints Jeopardy datasheet sources (i.e., *.jd
  files).

Dependencies
============

Haskell packages: see silverratio-jeopardy.cabal.

Helper Applications:

* sox/play

TeX Dependencies (runtime dependencies for jeopardy-compiler):

* Packages: standalone, ngerman (FIXME), anyfontsize.

Building
========

This package uses stack. Thus, assuming a working stack installation,
building should be as simple as typing

    $ stack build

Installation
============

    $ stack install

Datasheets
==========

The actualy content (answers & questions) is contained in so called
"jeopardy data files". A filename suffix of ".jd" specifies a jeopardy
data source file -- a file which can be edited with jeopardy-editor; a
filename suffix of ".jdc" specifies a jeopardy data file in compiled
form. The program jeopardy-compiler is responsible for compiling *.jd
files to *.jdc files (using LaTeX).

The repository https://github.com/mtesseract/silverratio-jeopardy-data
contains datasheets.

How to use
==========

Create a new jeopardy data template:

    $ jeopardy-editor --create foo.jd

Edit the data file:

    $ jeoaprdy-editor foo.jd

Compile the source file:

    $ jeopardy-compiler foo.jd foo.jdc

Run jeopardy:

    $ jeopardy

and, using the GUI, load the data file foo.jdc.

Sound Effects
=============

The program uses quite a few audio effects. The audio effects
installed by this program (they are located in the directory "Sounds")
are only placeholder files. They should be replaced by better audio
files. (If you know of matching, free(!) audio effects, please tell
me.)

Artwork
=======

Feel free to use better looking images (they are located in the
directory "Images").
